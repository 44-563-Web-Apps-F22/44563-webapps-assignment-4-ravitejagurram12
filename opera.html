    <h4>The Grand Duke- ACT 2</h4>
    <h5>SCENE : Entrance Hall of the Grand Ducal Palace.
        Enter a procession of the members of the theatrical company (now
        dressed in the costumes of Troilus and Cressida), carrying
        garlands, playing on pipes, citharae, and cymbals, and
        heralding the return of LUDWIG and JULIA from the marriage
        ceremony, which has just taken place.</h5>
    <p>
        BAR. Express your grief profound!<br>
        LUD.I shan't! This tone I never allow, my love.<br>
        BAR. Rudolph at once produce!<br>
        LUD. I can't; He isn't at home just now, my love.<br>
        BAR. (astonished).He isn't at home just now!<br>
        ALL. He isn't at home just now,
        (Dancing derisively.) He has an appointment particular,
        very-
        You'll find him, I think, in the town cemetery;
        And that's how we come to be making so merry,
        For he isn't at home just now!<br>

        BAR. But bless my heart and soul alive, it's impudence
        personified!
        I've come here to be matrimonially matrimonified!<br>

        LUD. For any disappointment I am sorry unaffectedly,
        But yesterday that nobleman expired quite unexpectedly—<br>

        ALL (sobbing). Tol the riddle lol!
        Tol the riddle lol!
        Tol the riddle, lol the riddle, lol lol lay!
        (Then laughing wildly.) Tol the riddle, lol the riddle, lol
        lol
        lay!<br>

        BAR. But this is most unexpected. He was well enough at a
        quarter to twelve yesterday.<br>
        LUD. Yes. He died at half-past eleven.<br>
        BAR. Bless me, how very sudden!<br>
        LUD. It was sudden.<br>
        BAR. But what in the world am I to do? I was to have been
        married to him to-day!<br>

        ALL (singing and dancing).
        For any disappointment we are sorry unaffectedly,
        But yesterday that nobleman expired quite unexpectedly—
        Tol the riddle lol!<br>

        BAR. Is this Court Mourning or a Fancy Ball?<br>
        LUD. Well, it's a delicate combination of both effects.
        It
        is intended to express inconsolable grief for the decease of the
        late Duke and ebullient joy at the accession of his successor. I
        am his successor. Permit me to present you to my Grand Duchess.
        (Indicating JULIA.)<br>
        BAR. Your Grand Duchess? Oh, your Highness! (Curtseying
        profoundly.)<br>
        JULIA (sneering at her). Old frump!<br>
        BAR. Humph! A recent creation, probably?<br>
        LUD. We were married only half an hour ago.<br>
        BAR. Exactly. I thought she seemed new to the position.<br>
        JULIA. Ma'am, I don't know who you are, but I flatter
        myself I can do justice to any part on the very shortest notice.<br>
        BAR. My dear, under the circumstances you are doing
        admirably—and you'll improve with practice. It's so difficult
        to be a lady when one isn't born to it.<br>
        JULIA (in a rage, to LUDWIG). Am I to stand this? Am I
        not
        to be allowed to pull her to pieces?<br>
        LUD. (aside to JULIA). No, no—it isn't Greek. Be a
        violet, I beg.<br>
        BAR. And now tell me all about this distressing
        circumstance. How did the Grand Duke die?<br>
        LUD. He perished nobly—in a Statutory Duel.<br>
        BAR. In a Statutory Duel? But that's only a civil
        death!—and the Act expires to-night, and then he will come to
        life again!<br>
        LUD. Well, no. Anxious to inaugurate my reign by
        conferring some inestimable boon on my people, I signalized this
        occasion by reviving the law for another hundred years.<br>
        BAR. For another hundred years? Then set the merry
        joybells ringing! Let festive epithalamia resound through these
        ancient halls! Cut the satisfying sandwich—broach the
        exhilarating Marsala—and let us rejoice to-day, if we never
        rejoice again!<br>
        LUD. But I don't think I quite understand. We have
        already
        rejoiced a good deal.<br>
