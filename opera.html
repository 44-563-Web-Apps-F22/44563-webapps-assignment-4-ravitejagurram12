        <p class="song">Broken every promise plighted—
              All is darksome—all is dreary.
              Every new-born hope is blighted!
              Sad and sorry—weak and weary
        Death the Friend or Death the Foe,
        Shall I call upon thee?  No!
        I will go on living, though
              Sad and sorry—weak and weary!</p>

        <p class="song-1">No, no!  Let the bygone go by!
              No good ever came of repining:
        If to-day there are clouds o'er the sky,
              To-morrow the sun may be shining!
                    To-morrow, be kind,
                    To-morrow, to me!
                    With loyalty blind
                    I curtsey to thee!
        To-day is a day of illusion and sorrow,
        So viva To-morrow, To-morrow, To-morrow!
              God save you, To-morrow!
              Your servant, To-morrow!
        God save you, To-morrow, To-morrow, To-morrow!</p>

        <h5 class="BAR">BAR.</h5> <p class="speech">But bless my heart and soul alive, it's impudence
        personified!
        I've come here to be matrimonially matrimonified!</p>

        <h5 class="LUD">LUD.</h5> <p class="speech">For any disappointment I am sorry unaffectedly,
        But yesterday that nobleman expired quite unexpectedly</p>

        <h5 class="ALL">ALL</h5> <p class="speech"><p class="direction">(sobbing).</p> Tol the riddle lol!
